This tool lets you extract group assignments from canvas for use
in preassigning Zoom breakout assignments.


It is currently hardwired to work at Iowa State University.
It uses ISU NetIDs as the common identifier between Canvas
and Zoom. As such you should instruct students to log in
to zoom via their ISU netid (using the "SSO" option and/or
https://iastate.zoom.us)

You will need to enable breakout rooms in your Zoom config.
Login to https://iastate.zoom.us/ then select Profile...
Settings... Breakout room. Also be sure to check the box
"Allow host to assign participants to breakout rooms when scheduling"

When scheduling the meeting check both the "Only authenticated users
can join" and the "Breakout room pre-assign" checkboxes. Then
import the .csv file generated by this tool


Installation instructions
-------------------------
Requires: Python 3.x (Anaconda suggested on most platforms)
From a suitable (Anaconda) command prompt, change to the
directory where you have placed the canvas_zoom_breakout
files, then install the prerequisite package (canvasapi),
and finally run the setup script: 
  pip install canvasapi
  python setup.py install

The above commands may need to be run with the same permissions
as the Python installation (e.g. as Administrator or root for
a central Python installation).


Running canvas_zoom_breakout
----------------------------
Copy and modify the script in the examples/ directory. You will
need to obtain and insert your own CANVAS_API_KEY. See the script
comments for instructions. You will also need to set the
course_name variable.

Then run your modified script using python. It works fine from the
command line, e.g. "python run_sync.py" from Spyder or Jupyter
qtconsole, e.g. "%run run_sync.py"

The generated .csv output will be in the current directory and
named based on the course_name.
